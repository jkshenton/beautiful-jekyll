Undergraduate:    
Studied condensed matter physics with the history, philosophy and social studies of science at UCL.

PhD:    
Investigated structure-function relationships in the room temperature multiferroic material, bismuth ferrite (BiFeO3). This was under the supervision of David Bowler [@MillionAtomMan](https://twitter.com/MillionAtomMan) at UCL and Wei Li Cheah at A*STAR in Singapore.

### now

I'm currently doing a post-doc in the Materials Theory group at ETH Zurich, working with Nicola Spaldin. We are investigating the effects positive muons have on the magnetism, crystal structure and charge carrier dynamics of the matter in which they are implanted.
