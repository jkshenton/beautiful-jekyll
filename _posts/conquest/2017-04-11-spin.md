### Summary of spin-related tags in CQ

|          Tag         |   Type     | Default value | Description |
|----------------------|------------|---------------|-------------|
| `Spin.SpinPolarised` |  boolean   |    False      | Should this be a spin polarised calculation?   |
| `Spin.FixSpin`       |  boolean   |    False      | Constrain the spin to initial values `TODO` does this constrain the spin on each atom, or just the total spin?  |
| `Spin.NeUP`          |    real    |    0.00       | Numer of electrons initialised to the spin up state |
| `Spin.NeDN`          |    real    |    0.00       | Numer of electrons initialised to the spin down state |
| `Spin.Magn`          |    real    |    0.00       | Total magnetic moment of system (i.e. NeUP - NeDN)  |


### Use cases

#### Basic spin polarised calculation

In order to turn on spin polarisation in Conquest you need to set the tag:
`Spin.SpinPolarised True`.

If none of the other spin-related tags are set, the default behaviour of CQ is to

#### Specifying total magnetic moment of system

You can specify the total magnetic moment of the system by setting the `Spin.Magn` tag.
For example if you want your Fe system with 16 electrons to start with all the electrons
in the spin up state, and none in the spin down state, you'd set:
`Spin.Magn  16.00`

To start the system in an antiferromagnetic state you can set `Spin.Magn  0.00`,
which would initialise half of the electrons in your system to the spin up and
half to the spin down state.
`TODO`: What's the default arrangement of these AFM spins?

If you want to constrain the spin to the initial spin setup (i.e. forcing it to remain
in the initial spin state), you can set `Spin.FixSpin True`.

Finally, you can set the number of electrons in each spin channel manually using
the `Spin.NeUP` and `Spin.NeDN` tags.
Note that these must of course sum to the total number of electrons in the system.

#### Initialising spin per atom - *development ongoing*

In many magnetic systems you might want to set the initial magnetic moments on
individual atoms (for example to achieve a specific antiferromagnetic ordering).

At present the method to do this requires you to define two species (and therefore
requires two .ion files) for each magnetic species. For example you might set:

```
## Atomic Information
%block ChemicalSpeciesLabel
1       55.845          Fe1
2       55.845          Fe2
%endblock ChemicalSpeciesLabel

%block Fe1
Atom.ValenceCharge 8.00
Atom.SpinNeUp 5.00
Atom.SpinNeDn 3.00
Atom.NumberOfSupports 15
Atom.SupportFunctionRange 8.4
Atom.InvSRange 8.4
%endblock Fe1

%block Fe2
Atom.ValenceCharge 8.00
Atom.SpinNeUp 3.00
Atom.SpinNeDn 5.00
Atom.NumberOfSupports 15
Atom.SupportFunctionRange 8.4
Atom.InvSRange 8.4
%endblock Fe2
```

in your Conquest_input file. Note that the .ion files would then have to be named
`Fe1.ion` and `Fe2.ion`, and that the structure file must reflect these duplicate species.

For example, for antiferromagnetic bcc iron you might have:

```
5.423514  0.000000  0.000000
0.000000  5.423514  0.000000
0.000000  0.000000  5.423514
2
0.000000  0.000000  0.000000   1
0.500000  0.500000  0.500000   2
```
