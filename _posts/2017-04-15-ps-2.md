title: Problem sheet 2
subtitle: Noisy quantum computing basics
---

This is a second in a series of problem sheets from the UCL course on quantum computing and quantum information.
It might be easier to read it on the [nbviewer site](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jkshenton/quantum_problems/blob/master/quantum_computing_problem_sheet_2.ipynb).

The first problem looks at quantum teleportation in the case where there is uncertainty as to the state of the shared resource.
That is to say: quantum teleportation in the when the shared resource is a mixed state.
The question asks to determine the average fidelity of the teleportation in such a setup.

The second problem is again about noise, this time in the context of the BB84 quantum key distribution protocol.
Alice is sending qubits through a noisy channel to Bob.
The question gives you the Kraus operators that define the noise in the channel
and asks you to calculate the probability of error in Bob's read-out due to the noise.
