title: Lissajous Curves
---

A while back I saw a bunch of lovely visualisations of Lissajous curves that came out on the back of the Coding Train's [video on the topic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--6eyLO78CY). I very much recommend watching that video to learn how one might make something similar. Here I'm just going to present one attempt of mine to create a visually pleasing 'Lissajous Table'.

I won't go into the background on the Lissajous curves as it's well-described on [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve) -- it's basically two periodic functions running at different frequencies that govern the x and y coordinate with time. 

Here, then, is my take on the Lissajous Table:

You can see and edit the code I used to make this visualisation [here](https://editor.p5js.org/bwana_shmane/sketches/WRBGJuSqK). I'd be happy to hear of any bugs or suggested improvements. You can also copy and remix the code using the previous link, all within p5.js' excellent in-browser editor.
